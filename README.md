This is the front-end for Credit Risk Liaison (CRL)

This website provites separate interfaces to whole-sellers and retailers, allowing each to interact with one another
and make efficient trades. If a user registers as a whole seller, they can set up their profile, place listings, 
receive orders from retailers, and respond to them. For each product listing, the platform allows the seller to add
descriptions, images, price levels (allowing discounts for high quantities), and stock levels. It also allows them to
interact with retailers who have placed orders to them, as well as view their business details (in order to make 
informed credit-lending decisions). 

If a user registers as a retailer, they're able to view and search through listings made by sellers, place orders, as
well as credit requests. They can also view their past orders (active, pending, accepted, cancelled, and completed).
Lastly, once integrated, the retailers will be able to use the credit score generator to add their reliability score 
to their profile, which can be viewed by the whole-sellers and used as a trust metric for making credit-based transactions
with the retailer
